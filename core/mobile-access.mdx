Qiton has been designed with accessibility in mind.
Since coaches and players are often on the move we provide a mobile application available on all platforms using PWA.
This way, you can access your precious data and statistics anytime, anywhere.

Here is how to set it up with iOS.

## Prerequisites

- An account

## Steps

Begin by retrieving your phone and opening [qiton.app](https://qiton.app).
Now tap on the share icon located at the bottom of the screen.

        alt="Mobile access step 1"
        width="250"
    />
</Frame>

Then **Add to Home Screen** button.

    <img
        src="./images/mobile-access/step-2.png"
        alt="Mobile access step 2"
        width="250"
