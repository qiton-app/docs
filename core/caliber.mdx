# What is Caliberâ„¢?

**Caliberâ„¢** is a **weights-based performance system** designed specifically for _Valorant_.

> It evaluates your impact differently based on your **agentâ€™s role**â€”so playing **Jett** wonâ€™t be judged the same way as **Omen**.

You get **custom-tailored ratings** that reflect both your role and your priorities in the match.

---

## Why use it?

Not every role should be measured the same way.

| Role        | Focus                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Duelist** | Entry, frags, clutch potential                         |
| **Sentinel**| Utility use, area control, team support                |
| **Controller/Initiator** | Map control, setup plays, enabling teammates |

<Callout emoji="ðŸŽ¯">
Thereâ€™s no such thing as a universal performance score in Valorant. Caliberâ„¢ fixes that.

## How it works

Adjust **weights** per role to define what matters most for each.
