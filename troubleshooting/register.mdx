During registration process, you may encounter the following error:
```
Account already exists
```

As we are currently in the beta phase, we have disabled the registration process intentionally.
Feel free to email us at [support@qiton.app](mailto:support@qiton.app) if you would like to be part of the beta testing phase, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
Don't forget that you need a GRID.GG token to use Qiton.
