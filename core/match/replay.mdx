The replay feature enables you to revisit all players’ moves, kills and abilities during a round.
As a coach, this feature provides valuable insights into your players’ strengths and weaknesses.

Imagine our feature as a music player, allowing you to start, pause and speed up the timeline.

- You have to select a match beforehand ([learn more](/core/match/root))
