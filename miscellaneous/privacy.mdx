We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right.
We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users.

## Policy

We do not and will never sell, license, sublicense or share any of the data submitted directly or indirectly by our
users with any person or entity.

## Design

Each user has a private database where Scrims and Officials will be stored.
This decreases the risk of data leaks (misuse of SQL queries).
