Sometimes, global statistics about a player may not be entirely accurate because he played multiple agents in Scrims
for testing purposes, but not in Officials.
That's why we provide statistics per agent.

## Prerequisites

- An active account ([learn more](/get-started/setup))
- You have to select a player beforehand ([learn more](/core/player/root))

## Steps

Navigate to the **Insights** tab.
