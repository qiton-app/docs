## Monitoring

We use automated tools to monitor the status of our services.
You can check it at any time by visiting [status.qiton.app](https://status.qiton.app).

### Marketing

All static content like videos, images, CSS, JS and HTML resources.
These resources should never be down as we are using load balancers.

So by loading [qiton.app](https://qiton.app), you are accessing the **Marketing** part.

### Dashboard

Very similar to the **Marketing** part, except that it applies to all dynamic content.

So by using Qiton as a customer, you are loading dynamic content to get your data.

### Valorant API

All images linked to the Valorant game (maps, agents, items).

### Docs

The page you are reading.

### Incidents

Sometimes we schedule maintenances to upgrade our infrastructure.
Additionally unplanned problems may occur and donâ€™t directly affect the entire website such as Valorant significant
changes.

We recommend that you regularly check [incidents.qiton.app](https://incidents.qiton.app) to monitor any current or
future incidents.
