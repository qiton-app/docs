## Metrics

Each Metrics score displayed on this page is calculated through the following steps.

1. For each player linked to **the selected team**, we calculate a Metrics score by considering **his primary roleâ€™s
preset** and **his statistics**.
2. We then calculate the final score by taking an **average** of all these scores.
