## Steps

Start by going to the series page at [qiton.app/series](https://qiton.app/series).

In order to make your experience smooth, we provide you with a beautiful list containing the latest scrims and officials.
When a new match ends, these data can take up to one hour to update.

## Filters

We’ve implemented some filters to meet your needs. You can sort matches by Agents, Teams, Tournaments, or Maps’ names.
Alternatively, you can use the search bar which provides a quick and generic way to search across all your matches.
