## Metrics

Each Metrics score displayed on this page is calculated through the following steps.

1. For each sub-match linked to **the selected match**, we calculate a Metrics score by considering **the role’s
preset** and **the player’s statistics**.
2. We then calculate the final score by taking a **weighted average** of all these scores.
