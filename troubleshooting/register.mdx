The sign-up form is intentionally disabled because currently we are creating accounts manually to ensure best services
for our customers.

Feel free to [contact us](/miscellaneous/pricing#getting-started) if you would like to test or purchase a specific
subscription, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
Don't forget that you need a GRID.GG active account to use Qiton.
