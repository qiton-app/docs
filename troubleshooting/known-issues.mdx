As Qiton is still in development, we are aware of some issues and limitations that we have.

## Total matches limit

Stored matches take a lot of space.
We are currently working on a limit per account which could be increased by contacting us.
By default, the limit is set to 50 matches per type per account (for example, 50 means 50 Officials and 50 Scrims at the
same time).
Obviously the oldest matches will be deleted first.

You can go to the settings page [here](https://qiton.app/settings) to be aware of your current plan.
