**Metrics** is a **weights-based performance system** designed specifically for _Valorant_.
> It evaluates your impact differently based on your **agent’s role**—so playing **Jett** won’t be judged the same way
as **Omen**.

You get **custom-tailored ratings** that reflect both your role and your priorities in the match.

## Why use it ?

Not every role should be measured the same way.

| Role                           | Focus                                           |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Duelist**                    | Entry, frags and clutch potential               |
| **Sentinel**                   | Utility use, area control and team support      |
| **Controller** & **Initiator** | Map control, setup plays and enabling teammates |

## Usage

You can change weights at any time during your journey as the component is always displayed at the bottom left.

## Where do I see Metrics scores ?

Metrics scores are shown **per match** and **averaged across matches or players** for deeper insights.

Depending on the pages, we could use **the Global** or **role** preset.
Please refer to the documentation.
Whenever a Metrics score is displayed, we precise the preset in use.
