Our Metrics feature allows coaches to assign weights to statistics based on their personal preferences and the perceived
importance of those statistics for a specific role.
**For instance, you might believe that a duelist should prioritize ADR over HS.**

After aggregating all these weights, we calculate a score ranging **from 0 to 100**.

As you may understand, these scores are primarily focused on individual players, but they can also be used more broadly
to evaluate the performance of a team by calculating an average of its players.

## Usage

You can change weights at any time during your journey as the component is always displayed at the bottom left.

## Available presets

- `Global`
- `Duelist`
- `Sentinel`
- `Controller`
- `Initiator`

## What preset is used ?

Depending on the pages, we could use **the Global** or **role** preset.
Please refer to the documentation.
Whenever a Metrics score is displayed, we precise the preset in use.
