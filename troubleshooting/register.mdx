During registration process, you may encounter the following error.
> Account already exists

As we are currently in the beta phase, we have disabled the registration process intentionally.
Feel free to [contact us](/miscellaneous/releases#v0-10-0) if you would like to be part of the beta testing phase, and
we will get back to you as soon as possible.
Don't forget that you need a GRID.GG token to use Qiton.
